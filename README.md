## Introduction

RACEMAN is a research project aimed at developing a robust and adaptive intrusion detection system for Online Social Networks (OSNs).

## Background

With the increasing prevalence of Online Social Networks (OSNs), the need for robust and adaptive security measures has never been greater. Traditional intrusion detection systems often fall short when applied to the dynamic and complex nature of OSNs.

## Key Features

- Data Preprocessing
- Feature Selection using Metamorphic Relations
- Classification Algorithms
- Collaborative and Distributed IDS
- Performance Evaluation Metrics

## Our Solution

RACEMAN employs a variety of machine learning algorithms, feature selection techniques, and metamorphic relations to achieve high accuracy and low computational overhead.

## Benefits

- High Accuracy
- Low Computational Overhead
- Scalability
- Adaptability to Evolving Threats

## Algorithms

- Data Cleaning Algorithm
- Data Preprocessing Algorithm
- Training and Testing of RACEMAN
- Feature Selection
- Classification
- Collaborative and Distributed mechanism

## Feature Selection

We employ metamorphic relations for feature selection, which enhances the model's ability to generalize across different datasets.

## Classification

Various machine learning models including Random Forest, SVM, and Neural Networks are used for the classification of intrusions.

## Getting Started

### Installation

Please refer to the `INSTALL.md` for detailed installation instructions.

### Testing

To run the RACEMAN model in R, execute the following command:

```R
source("run_raceman.R")
```
