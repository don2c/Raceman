## Introduction

RACEMAN is a research project aimed at developing a robust and adaptive intrusion detection system for Online Social Networks (OSNs).

## Background

With the increasing prevalence of Online Social Networks (OSNs), the need for robust and adaptive security measures has never been greater. Traditional intrusion detection systems often fall short when applied to the dynamic and complex nature of OSNs.

## Key Features

- Data Preprocessing
- Feature Selection using Metamorphic Relations
- Classification Algorithms
- Collaborative and Distributed IDS
- Performance Evaluation Metrics

## Our Solution

RACEMAN employs a variety of machine learning algorithms, feature selection techniques, and metamorphic relations to achieve high accuracy and low computational overhead.

## Benefits

- High Accuracy
- Low Computational Overhead
- Scalability
- Adaptability to Evolving Threats

## Algorithms

- Data Cleaning Algorithm
- Data Preprocessing Algorithm
- Training and Testing of RACEMAN
- Feature Selection
- Classification
- Collaborative and Distributed mechanism

## Feature Selection

We employ metamorphic relations for feature selection, which enhances the model's ability to generalize across different datasets.

## Classification

Various machine learning models including Random Forest, SVM, and Neural Networks are used for the classification of intrusions.

Certainly! Here's how you can incorporate the "Getting Started" section into the existing `readme.md` content:

## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you through the process of setting up and running the RACEMAN project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following software installed on your machine:

- Git
- R (version 3.6 or newer)
- RStudio (optional, but recommended)

### Installation

#### Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/RACEMAN.git
cd RACEMAN
```

#### Install Dependencies

Once inside the project directory, install the required R packages. You can usually do this within R or RStudio by running:

```R
install.packages("package-name")
```

Replace `package-name` with the packages required for this project.

### Configuration

If the project requires any configuration (like setting environment variables), mention the steps here. For instance, you might need to set some API keys or database credentials:

```R
Sys.setenv(API_KEY = "your-api-key")
```

### Running the Project

Now, you can run the RACEMAN model:

```R
source("run_raceman.R")
```

The model should now execute and provide output metrics based on the dataset used.

### Testing

To run the tests for the project, execute the following command:

```R
source("run_tests.R")
```
